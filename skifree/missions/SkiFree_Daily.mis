// MissionTypes = SinglePlayer
// DisplayName = SkiFree Daily Challenge

//--- MISSION BRIEFING BEGIN ---
//The daily challenge of SkiFree.
//
//A new level will be generated every day. A completely random terrain that nobody has ever seen before, until now.
//
//Since the level will be the same regardless of who is playing, you can share times! Talk about how much better you are than everyone else! Forget about the time zone conversions and end up talking about the wrong map! Get banned from Discord for spamming this crap months after everyone else stops caring about it!
//
//Difficulty will determine how hard the terrain is. So it can really be thought of as a three-in-one challenge. Easy and Medium will just be varying levels of fBM Fractal, which makes some nice rolling hills. But the Hard terrain? You'll have to see it to believe it.
